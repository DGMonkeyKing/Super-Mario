# Super-Mario
A Super Mario game powered by Quintus

##What is Quintus?
To know more about Quintus game engine, I suggest to visit the main page of the engine: http://www.html5quintus.com/. 
If you want to download the engine to make your own games or maybe to collaborate with the project, you can found the repository on Github.

##Running the game
To run this game in a browser is necessary to use a web server. You don't need to buy or own one, there are several programs that emulates a 
web server. The one I used was XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html.

Once you have XAMPP installed, open XAMPP Panel Control and select one of the modules (In this case, I chose Apache) and wait until the name's 
module glows green.

With this done, all that left to do is to copy the root folder on the game on the path:

_**your-own-installation-path/xampp/htdocs**_

and in the browser search for the path:

_**localpath/root-folder-of-project**_.
